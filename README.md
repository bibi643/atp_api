# FastAPI


# Overview
Repo to practice the building of all main routes in an API using ATP tennis male match datas.


# Note

The route put new player would not be constructed this way in a real case scenario. Here we created a new player and add to the player database. In a real case scenario, a new match would be added to the data_raw file with this new player involved. We just want to test a code for a put/post and delete route.
